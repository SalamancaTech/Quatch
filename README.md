The Game of Quatch


Basics:

2-4 players
The goal for the player is to get rid of all their cards.
Each deck is modified to only include a single 2 and a single 10 each, the suit can be randomized at the start of each game.
The player holds a minimum of 3 cards
The player with the lowest card starts the game by placing it in th “Pile”
The player with the next lowest card goes next, which will determine the rotation of gameplay
Now the gameplay loop begins.

Gameplay loop:
The card on top of the “Pile” is the “Target Card” to beat.
The card can only be beat by a card by an equal or greater value.
Multiple cards can be played at the same time, but only if they are the same value.
If a 4 of a kind is ever laid (either all at once, or in a series) it will trigger the “Discard Event” 
If a 10 is ever played, it will trigger the “Discard Event
If a 2 is ever played it will trigger the “Reset Event” 
A 2 can be played on any card regardless of value

Events:
“Play” - One or multiple cards are selected, then transferred to the “Pile”, the player (or opponent) then draws the amount of cards that would total a minimum of 3 cards in the hand. If the player already has a minimum of 3 cards, then no new cards are dealt, and the turn ends.
“Eat” - When the player (or opponent) doesn’t have a card in an equal or greater value, ALL cards from the “Pile” into the “Hand” of the player (or opponent) and then the next player gets to lay down whichever card they choose. If the opponent has the choice, they should favor the lower end cards, but has permission to play any card from the “Hand”.
“Discard Event” - All cards in the “Pile” get transferred to the “Bin” 
“Reset Event” - any card (or multiple of the card) may be played next, regardless of value
“LC Event” - Only applicable in Stage 5, the event is triggered by the player or opponent being unable to match or beat the “Target Card” - The the “Eat” event will trigger and the player cannot progress through Stage 5, until all cards are cleared from their “Hand” at which point the “LC Event” ends.
“LS Event” - Only applicable in Stage 6, the event is triggered by the player or opponent being unable to match or beat the “Target Card” - The the “Eat” event will trigger and the player cannot progress through Stage 6, until all cards are cleared from their “Hand” at which point the “LS Event” ends.
“Win Event” - Only applicable upon the completion of Stage 6, player or opponent must be able to beat the “Target Card” with their final card. The final card must NOT lead into a “Discard Event” or “Reset Event”, either of those outcomes will instead force an “Eat” event, and the game will continue until the “Hand” is emptied (without triggering either “Discard” or “Reset” events). The player or opponent who achieves the “Win Event” first, is the Winner!


Layout:
“Pile” - The very center of the board, this is where the cards will be played.
“Hand” - this is where the players cards are held and dealt to, and this is where the player will select which cards to play into the “Pile” 
“Bin” - this is where cards from the “Pile” can be discarded when the “Discard Event” happens. Cards in the “Bin” remain there until the end of the game.
“Last Stand” (“LS”) - Three face down cards, located between the “Hand” and the “Pile” 
“Last Chance” (“LC”) - Three face up cards, placed directly on top of the “LS”

Stages:
Stage 1: Total amount of 10 and 2 cards reduced to one each, Cards are shuffled, “Last Stand” is dealt to all players/opponents, “Last Chance” is dealt to all players/opponents. Three cards are dealt to the “Hand” of all players/opponents.
Stage 2: The player and the opponents are allowed to (but are not required to) switch any of the  cards between the “Hand” and the “Last Chance”
Stage 3: Gameplay Loop
Stage 4: Once all cards from the “Deck” have been distributed, the player and opponents will no longer need to have a minimum of 3, and the goal for the players and opponents is to get rid of all the cards left in their “Hand”
Stage 5: This stage is only applied to the player or opponent who has successfully completed Stage 4, The player or opponent can select from only their own “Last Chance” section. 
Stage 6: The player or opponent can select from only their own “Last Stand” section, the player may only select one card at a time, the card selected must either be able to be played, or else the “LS Event” happens
